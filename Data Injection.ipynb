Our independence didn’t come easily. It was earned through the blood, sweat, and tears of countless individuals who believed in the power of liberty and justice. They envisioned a nation where every person could live with dignity, where freedom of speech, of thought, and of action would be safeguarded, and where the rights of every individual would be respected.\\n\\nAs we look back on the struggles of our forefathers, let us remember that the journey towards independence was not just about breaking free from the shackles of external control. It was also about forging a nation built on the values of **democracy**, **unity**, **justice**, and **equality**. These values are not just words; they are the guiding principles that continue to shape our nation's future.\\n\\nToday, we are the custodians of this hard-won freedom, and it is our responsibility to preserve and protect the liberties that so many before us fought to give us. We must not take our independence for granted, but rather, we must honor it every day through our actions and choices.\\n\\nAs we celebrate this special day, let us reflect on how far we have come as a nation. We have made strides in education, healthcare, technology, and infrastructure. We have built a society that welcomes diversity and encourages the free exchange of ideas. But we must not stop here. Our journey is far from over. There are still challenges to overcome, inequalities to address, and a brighter future to create.\\n\\nLet us also take this opportunity to recognize the sacrifices of those who continue to serve and protect our country – our soldiers, our healthcare workers, our teachers, and all those who work tirelessly for the welfare of the nation. Their contributions, often behind the scenes, are the foundation of the freedom we enjoy today.\\n\\nIn this age of globalization, it is easy to forget the significance of our sovereignty. But let us remember that independence is not just about freedom from external control; it is also about freedom to shape our own destiny. We must strive to be a nation that leads with compassion, that upholds the values of peace, justice, and fairness, and that ensures every individual has the opportunity to thrive.\\n\\nAs we look towards the future, let us continue to honor the ideals of freedom, democracy, and equality. Let us work together, hand in hand, to build a stronger, more unified nation—one that future generations will be proud to inherit.\\n\\nLet this Independence Day be a reminder of our collective strength, of our shared history, and of the endless possibilities that lie ahead. Together, we can achieve great things, and together, we will continue to make our nation a beacon of hope and freedom for all.\\n\\n**Happy Independence Day!**\\n\")]"

Competition: A Single Explanatory Framework\\nfor Attention?\\nA CLOSER LOOK: Competition and Selection\\nRevisit and Reflect\\nLearning Objectives\\nA t a very large and very noisy party, you’re looking for a friend you’ve lost in the crowd. You\\nlook for her green dress amid the sea of colors. You try to catch the sound of her voice in the gen-\\neral roar. There she is! Somehow, above the loud music and noisy conversation, now you hear her\\ncalling your name. But before you can move very far, you are stopped in your tracks by the sound\\nof shattering glass—you turn your head sharply and see that a pitcher has fallen off a nearby table.\\nWhile others tend to the glass, you set of f across the crowded room toward your friend.\\nThe processes by which you were able to spot your friend, hear your name despite the\\nnoise of the party, and then quickly turn toward and then away from the sound of the break-\\ning glass involved attention. In the context of human information processing, attention is the\\nprocess that, at a given moment, enhances some information and inhibits other information.\\nThe enhancement enables us to select some information for further processing, and the in-\\nhibition enables us to set some information aside.\\nThroughout life—indeed, throughout the day and throughout the minute—we are bom-\\nbarded by an overwhelming amount of perceptual information; the party is simply a highly\\ndramatic example of what’s going on all the time.

How do\\nwe, moment to moment, choose the information that is meaningful and avoid distraction by\\nirrelevant material? One solution is to focus on some particular piece of information (such as\\nthe sound of your own name or a color of interest) and to select it for processing in preference\\nto other bits of available information because of its immediate importance in a given situation.\\nIs attention, then, something that we summon up by will that enables concentration on some\\npiece of the incoming stimuli? The answer, briefly, is yes; but this is not the whole story. Even\\nif our intentions and goals are clear and we know exactly what information we are interested\\nin, other aspects of the input, if sufficiently salient, can capture our attention and distract us,\\nas the sudden noise of breaking glass interrupted your search for your friend.\\nA host of questions immediately arises: while we are attending to one thing, do we ac-\\ntively inhibit and suppress distractions, or do we simply ignore them and let them hover in the\\nbackground? What happens to the information to which we do not attend? What brain sys-\\ntems and mechanisms underlie these attentional abilities, and what disorders arise when\\nthese systems and mechanisms are damaged?\\nThis chapter explores attention as a cognitive ability. We specifically address four issues:\\n1. What is attention, and how does it operate during cognition?\\n2. What information-processing models have been devised to understand attention?\\n3. How have new techniques for studying the brain enhanced our understanding of\\nattention?\\n4. Attention, according to one contemporary theory, is a competition among different\\nsources of information, all jockeying for further processing. Can such a theory ex-\\nplain both the behavioral and brain perspectives on attention?\\n1. THE NATURE AND ROLES OF ATTENTION\\nAlthough we have an intuitive understanding of what it means to “pay attention” to\\nan object or event, the study of attention has a long and checkered history in cogni-\\ntive psychology, filled with debate and disagreement. Some have suggested that\\n“everyone knows what attention is;” others have countered that “no one knows what\\nattention is” (Pashler, 1998). For example, Moray (1970) proposed six different mean-\\nings of the term attention, whereas Posner and Boies (1971) suggested that attention\\nhas three components: orienting to sensory events, detecting signals for focused pro-\\ncessing, and maintaining a vigilant or alert state. Still others have used terms such as\\narousal, effort, capacity, perceptual set, control, and consciousness as synonymous\\nwith the process of attention. Adding to the difficulty is the problem of designing and\\ncarrying out careful and systematic studies of attention, for the very reason that at-\\ntentional selection seems to occur so naturally and effortlessly that it is difficult to pin\\ndown experimentally.\\nNonetheless, there is broad agreement that attention involves selecting some in-\\nformation for further processing and inhibiting other information from receiving\\nfurther processing. One possible way to understand how this might work is to ex-\\nplore what happens when attention fails. After this, we will examine what happens\\nwhen attention succeeds. Outlining the failures and successes will allow us to develop\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 104 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Thereafter, we will present some theories of atten-\\ntion and some experiments that look at how attention operates in the brain.\\n1.1. Failures of Selection\\nWhen we fail to attend to information, what kind of information do we miss? One sort\\nof failure occurs when there is a lot of information simultaneously present in front of\\nyou, as at a party, and you are simply not capable of noticing all of it at once. These fail-\\nures are referred to as failures of selection in space . Failure can also occur with informa-\\ntion that unfolds in time. When new information (even if only a small amount) arrives in\\na rapid stream, spending time processing it will cause you to miss some other incoming\\ninformation, resulting in what are called failures of selection in time . These failures to\\nattend to information in space or in time are a by-product of a system that prevents us\\nfrom becoming overloaded with irrelevant information—that is, of a system of selective\\nattention. As such, these failures are an important part of effective cognitive processing\\nand highlight the function of attention. Later, when we come to theories of attention, it\\nwill be important to remember that understanding attention is as much about informa-\\ntion that is not selected as well as information that is selected. In the following subsec-\\ntions, we provide illustrative examples of failures and successes of attentional selection.\\n1.1.1. Failures of Selection in Space\\nFailures of selection in space can be of surprising magnitude. You’d notice, wouldn’t\\nyou, if someone who stopped you on the street to ask for directions suddenly changed\\ninto a different person in the middle of the conversation. Actually, you might not.\\nDemonstrations of the failure to detect changes between flashes of the same scene have\\nnow been replicated many times. Perhaps the most dramatic of these was a demon-\\nstration by Simons and Levin (1998) in which an experimenter stopped pedestrians on\\na college campus to ask for directions. During each conversation, two people carrying\\na door walked between the experimenter and the pedestrian. As they did, the experi-\\nmenter switched places with a second experimenter who had been concealed behind\\nthe door as it was being carried. This second experimenter then continued the conver-\\nsation with the pedestrian. Only half the pedestrians reported noticing the change of\\nspeaker—even when they were explicitly asked, “Did you notice that I am not the\\nsame person who first approached you to ask for directions?” This failure to detect\\nchanges in the physical aspects of a scene has been referred to as change blindness\\n(Simons & Rensink, 2005). This phenomenon often goes to the movies: errors in con-\\ntinuity, such as the switch from the breakfast croissant to the pancake in Pretty\\nWoman, go unnoticed by many in the audience. We can also be insensitive to changes\\nin modalities other than vision. It has been shown that we miss changes between voices\\nin an auditory scene, a phenomenon referred to as change deafness (Vitevitch, 2003).\\nThat we miss some perceptual information is interesting. Even more interest-\\ning from a cognitive perspective is the implication that this does not occur by\\nchance: we are selecting only partial information from the world around us and\\nare not very attentive to the rest. Change blindness indicates that not all available\\ninformation is attended and subsequently represented. Fortunately for our evolu-\\ntionary survival, those aspects of the input that are more relevant and meaningful\\n1.

This finding suggests that although\\nFIGURE 3–1 Changes in the scene\\n(a) A change of marginal interest (the height of the railing) and (b) a change of central interest (the po-\\nsition of the distant helicopter).

If\\nyou’re hungry, you may notice a basket of luscious-looking fruit on a nearby table—\\nbut if you’ve just eaten, your attention may glide right over it with barely a pause.\\nKnowledge, beliefs, goals and expectations can alter the speed and accuracy of the\\nprocesses that select meaningful or desired information; that’s what is happening\\nwhen you rapidly scan a book to find a particular reference and are able to skip over\\nlarge, irrelevant passages of material. The ability to use top-down processing to af-\\nfect selection and attention is highly adaptive and such processing is an efficient way\\nof extracting critical information from a flood of input.\\nHowever, because of the wealth of competing stimuli, top-down attentional selec-\\ntion does not always lead immediately to your goal. For example, in the opening scene\\nat the party, the moment you recognized that the flash of green was your friend’s dress\\nwas probably not the first moment that patch of green had appeared in your visual\\nfield, and the first time you heard your name was probably not the first time your\\nfriend had called to you. Further, you were actively diverted from looking for your\\nfriend by the sound of the crashing glass—your top-down processing was overridden\\nby a sensory event, that is, by bottom-up attentional processing. The result? Failure in\\nspace: attention was captured away from the current goal of seeking your friend.\\nFailures to select information in space can also occur when far fewer stimuli are\\npresent. For instance, if you are presented with only two sources of information\\nsimultaneously (say, a drama on television and a story in the newspaper) and are\\nrequired to process both, you will not be able to do them both full justice. The ability\\nto attend to two sources is impaired compared to the ability to process information\\nfrom one source alone: there is a cost associated with doing both tasks together.\\nWhen you try to do both things at once, there are two possibilities: either you will\\nfollow the television plot perfectly and lose the news story altogether (or the other\\nway round), or you will lose parts of both show and story.\\nConcentration on one source of input to the exclusion of any other is known\\nas focused attention ; in cases of divided attention , in which more than one source\\nis attended, the information selected is imperfect (as in the example of following\\npart of the newspaper story and part of the television story). One explanation for\\nthe loss of information when attention is divided is that the two sources of infor-\\nmation vie for limited attentional resources, which are sometimes described as\\n“mental effort.” An oversimplified but helpful image is that we each have a pool\\nof attentional effort into which each task taps. The harder the tasks, and the more\\nof them there are at any one time, the more of such “mental effort” is drawn from\\nthe pool. When the available capacity is less than that required for completion of\\na task, failures are more frequent. When tasks are easier or fewer, there is less de-\\nmand on this limited resource.\\nOne clear example of what happens when attention is divided comes from a\\nstudy conducted by Neisser and Becklen (1975).

In one, two people were playing a hand game in\\nwhich one player tries to slap the opponent’s hand; in the other, three men were\\nthrowing a basketball and moving about (Figure 3–2). When participants were in-\\nstructed to track one of the two games, they were successful; but keeping track of\\nboth games at once was almost impossible.\\nA divided-attention task like this one seems, at first blush, artificial. Yet this is\\nexactly what, after much practice with simulations, highly trained air traffic con-\\ntrollers do, with many simultaneous stimuli to monitor (Figure 3–3). Fortunately,\\nthose who do this kind of work have sufficient expertise and skill that failures are\\nextremely rare.\\n1.1.2. Failures of Selection in Time\\nJust as there are limitations on the quantity of information that can be processed si-\\nmultaneously in space, there are limitations on the speed with which information\\ncan be processed in temporal sequence. These limitations, of differing degree and\\nquality, apply to everyone.\\nPerhaps the simplest way to determine how fast information can be processed is\\nto ask participants to report the presence of stimuli shown in a rapid sequence. Re-\\nsearchers interested in the question of the temporal constraints of attention have de-\\nveloped experiments that push the attentional processing system to its limit. In such\\nstudies (e.g., Shapiro et al., 1984), participants are shown a stream of letters, one of\\nthem (denoted by the researchers as the first target , or T1, letter) white and the rest\\nFIGURE 3–2 Divided attention\\nDrawings of (a) a frame from the video sequence of a hand-slapping game and (b) one from the bas-\\nketball game.

The interesting finding is that, in the dual-report condition, participants\\nfailed to report T2 on the occasions when it appeared between about 100 and 500 mil-\\nliseconds after an appearance of T1 (remember, other letters intervene). After greater\\ndelays between an appearance of T1 and an appearance of T2, however, participants\\nwere again able to spot the T2. The decrease in performance in reporting a T2 if it ap-\\npears within a certain temporal window following the appearance of a T1 is an in-\\nstance of attentional blink. As the term suggests, attentional blink is a short period\\nduring which incoming information is not registered, similar in effect to the physical\\nblanking out of visual information during the blink of an eye. The phenomenon of at-\\ntentional blink also occurs for two objects (not just letters) that are presented in rapid\\nsuccession (Raymond, 2003). The hallmark of attentional blink is the missed detection\\nof a stimulus that is presented within a particular time frame after an earlier stimulus\\nis presented. When stimuli are presented so quickly, attention to the first seems to pre-\\nclude attention to the second—showing the failure to select items in time.\\nA similar effect involves the failure to detect objects presented in a rapid sequence\\nwhen some of these stimuli are identical, even when the stimuli are shown for a long\\nenough time to avoid the attentional blink. For example, Kanwisher and colleagues\\n(1997b) showed participants a sequence of nine serially presented displays with two\\nor three consecutive pictures sandwiched in between visually “noisy” patterns called\\nmasks (Figure 3–5). A large masking field was also shown at the beginning and end\\nof each trial. Each image was shown for 100 milliseconds. The important finding is\\nthat when the first and third picture in the series were identical, participants were\\nmarkedly less likely to report seeing the third picture (the repeat). This was also true\\nwhen the first and third pictures depicted the same object even if the objects were of\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nFIGURE 3–5 A demonstration of repetition blindness\\nMasks and (center) representational pictures were shown to participants.

When the two pictures were\\nof different objects, however, participants had no problem identifying the third pic-\\nture. The failure to detect the later appearance of a stimulus when the stimuli are pre-\\nsented in a rapid sequence has been termed repetition blindness (Kanwisher, 1987).\\nRepetition blindness can occur for words as well as for objects. For example,\\nwhen the sentence “It was work time so work had to get done” was presented rap-\\nidly, participants failed to detect the second occurrence of “work” and recalled the\\nsequence as “It was work time so had to get done” (Kanwisher, 1991). Blindness to\\na repetition can also be observed if several words come between the two instances of\\nthe repeated word or even if they are written in different styles (“WORK” and\\n“work”). It is believed that the failure to encode the second stimulus occurs because\\nit is not individuated or selected as a distinct event when it rapidly follows the first.\\nInstead, the second occurrence is assimilated to the first, and only one event is regis-\\ntered. The phenomenon of repetition blindness suggests that when we do not have\\nmuch time, we do not form a second, separate representation of an object we have\\njust processed and so are not aware of the repetition.\\n1.1.3. Sources of Limitation\\nWhy do we fail to select information in space or in time? Some have argued that the\\nfailure is on the sensory end; that is, the limitation is, literally, in the eye of the be-\\nholder (or, if the stimuli are auditory, in the ear of the beholder). Human peripheral\\nvision is not very precise, and, in many studies, the information that participants\\nmiss appears at the edges of the screen. But failures to select all the information pres-\\nent cannot be explained solely by the drop-off in visual acuity for information ap-\\npearing farther from the center of the visual field. In the Neisser and Becklen study\\n(with superimposed video sequences), for example, all the necessary information ap-\\npeared in the center of the screen. In the attentional blink and repetition blindness\\nstudies, the information is also presented in the center of the field. In these circum-\\nstances, then, the failure cannot be one of poor vision. Rather, the limitation appears\\nto have to do with the quantity of information. Some models propose the notion of\\na bottleneck ,a  r e s t r i c t i o n  o n  t h e  a m o u n t  o f  i n f o r m a t i o n  t h a t  c a n  b e  p r o c e s s e d  a t\\nonce; because of the bottleneck, certain critical mental operations have to be carried\\nout sequentially (Pashler & Johnston, 1998).\\nDivided-attention studies demonstrate that performance is hampered when you\\nhave to attend to two separate sources of visual information (like the television\\nscreen and the newspaper page) or two separate visual events (the hand-slapping\\ngame and the basketball play). There is also an added cost in accuracy or reaction\\ntime when you attempt to perform two tasks at once. In all these cases, the decre-\\nment in performance is referred to as dual-task interference .\\nOne might wonder whether this decrement occurs because there is too much in-\\nterference when all the information is similar, because it is all visual (or is all uditory)\\nand we simply cannot cope with the quantity of data presented. There is, in fact,\\ngreater interference when the sources are both of the same type of information than\\nwhen they are different (Brooks, 1968).

By the same\\ntoken, a spatial task such as visualizing a map of the United States and scanning\\nalong its borders, noticing which states are wider than they are tall, would impede\\nrecall of a picture but not of a sentence.\\nBut the limitation is more general, and the failure to select information can occur\\neven if the two sources of information are of two different types, or even if the infor-\\nmation is presented in two different sensory modalities, say, one auditory and one\\nvisual, although the interference is not as great as when the types of information are\\nthe same. Some investigators believe that the extent of the interference depends on\\nthe extent of the “cross-talk” between the various representations and processes\\ndrawn upon by the incoming information: if similar representations and processes are\\nactivated in the two tasks, they may be confused. For example, both recalling a sen-\\ntence and counting engage verbal representations; these representations may infiltrate\\neach other and hinder processing. But recalling a sentence and visualizing a map of\\nthe United States have less overlap of representations and, hence, produce less inter-\\nference with each other. A practical issue in dual tasking is discussed in the accompa-\\nnying Debate box.\\nThe bottlenecks in attention we have looked at so far have all been perceptual:\\ntoo many competing stimuli, or fewer stimuli but of the same type and therefore com-\\npeting. A bottleneck in attention can also occur when, even with a single sensory in-\\nput, the outputs required are too great. In such cases, the bottleneck is motor in\\nnature. Consider this: You’ve just picked up a ringing phone. The only sensory input\\nis the sound of the caller’s voice. The call is not for you. Is your roommate around?\\nYou have to check. The caller’s in a hurry—can you take a message? Sure—where’s\\nthe pad . . . and while you’re looking you’ve missed the beginning of the message.\\nOK—but now the pencil’s dropped . . . gosh, this is taking a long time. . . . One sen-\\nsory stimulus is requiring a number of responses. Coordinating them will be difficult,\\nand some information will be missed, unless you take all the required responses a lit-\\ntle more slowly or in turn. As with multiple sensory inputs, coordinating two output\\nresponses is more difficult than simply making a single response. It is not impossible\\nto do two things at once, and, indeed, we can get better at this with practice, but there\\nis usually some associated cost or failure even when one is skilled.\\nJust as divided-attention failures, in which sensory information is not attended,\\ndo not result from a limitation in vision, the failures in motor output when you try\\nto do a number of things at once or in quick succession do not result from a limita-\\ntion in the ability to program your muscles to move. Back to the party for a mo-\\nment: you’ve found your friend and are comfortably chatting. Someone offers you\\na sandwich, but you’re holding a glass in your right hand, your dominant one. You\\nhesitate: should you put the glass down (where?) and take the sandwich with your\\nright hand, or take the sandwich with your left hand? The interference, in the form\\nof a slowing down of your actions, that arises when you try to select between two\\npossible responses to even a sole sensory stimulus is referred to as a response bot-\\ntleneck .T h e  a d d i t i o n a l  t i m e  n e e d e d  t o  m o v e  t h r o u g h  t h i s  k i n d  o f  b o t t l e n e c k  h a s\\nbeen measured experimentally.

Preliminary experiments determined that it took about 500 milliseconds for\\nparticipants to press the foot pedal after the onset of the tone. If the light flashed (re-\\nquiring the left-hand response) 50 milliseconds before the tone sounded, participants\\ntook even longer than the 500 milliseconds to press the pedal. Response selection for\\nthe tone–pedal could not begin until the response selection for the light had been\\ncompleted, accounting for the additional time to press the pedal (Pashler, 1998).\\nThe use of cellular phones has skyrocketed worldwide in the last\\nfew years. Recent surveys have shown that about 85 percent of cell-phone users in the United\\nStates use a cell phone while driving. Redelmeier and Tibshirani (1997) found that cell-phone use\\nwas associated with a fourfold increase in the likelihood of an accident. (Note that, in many states, it is il-\\nlegal to drive and use a handheld phone, which makes sense given the increased risk of accidents when\\ncell phones are used.) What we do not know from this early study is whether the accidents occur more of-\\nten when people are dialing a number, when they are talking, or when they are reaching for the phone; that\\nis, whether there is more dual-task interference in some conditions than in others.\\nMore recent studies try to sort out these possibilities. For example, Strayer and Johnston (2001) de-\\nsigned an experiment in which participants undertook a simulated driving task requiring them to “follow” a\\ntarget car. Participants were assigned randomly to one of three conditions: during the driving task, some\\nparticipants listened to a radio program of their choosing (group 1); others conversed on a cell phone about\\nthe presidential election of 2000 or the Olympic games on either a handheld (group 2) or hands-free\\n(group 3) phone. At irregular intervals, a signal flashed red or green; participants were instructed to press\\na “brake” button when they saw a red signal. The experimenters recorded both the number of times the\\nparticipants missed the red signal and the time it took for the individual to press the brake button.\\nThe results were straightforward: both cell-phone groups missed the red signal twice as many times\\nas did the radio group; and when they did spot the signal, their response (measured by the time to press\\nthe brake button) came later. This lag in response time was more pronounced when the participant was\\ntalking rather than listening. The difference in performance between the radio and cell-phone groups could\\nnot be explained by different levels of driving skills in the two groups; all participants performed the driving\\ntask alone (no cell phone) and there was no difference in performance between the groups in this single-\\ntask condition. It was only the addition of the cell-phone task that led to the different results.\\nIn just what way is attention affected? In a follow-up study, Strayer, Drews, and Johnston (2003)\\nshowed that the consequence of adding the task of conducting a phone conversation to the task of driv-\\ning led the participants to withdraw attention from the visual scene. Participant drivers who held cell-\\nphone conversations missed or had imperfect recall of billboard signs along the route. It turns out that\\nthese drivers did not really look at the information: the eye movements of drivers who were talking on the\\nphone were not drawn to information along the route, even when it was presented in the center of the vi-\\nsual field and, consequently, they had poorer memory for that information. These failures to process and\\nselect information are very similar to those reported in other experiments on failures to select information;\\nin all cases, the participants could not take in all the visual information that is present and, therefore,\\nfocused on only small amounts.\\nCars and Conversation DEBATE\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 114 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

The Nature and Roles of Attention 115\\n1.1.4. Problems in Interpretation\\nAlthough cognitive psychologists have spent a great deal of time and effort examining\\ndivided attention and the costs associated with dual tasks, many questions remain. For\\none thing, researchers can never guarantee that the two sources of input are always be-\\ning attended simultaneously, or that the two outputs are always being selected simulta-\\nneously, or that the two tasks are always performed simultaneously. Even under\\nconditions in which one task apparently demands constant attention (for example, driv-\\ning), it appears that the same level of attention is not required at every single moment.\\nAn effective strategy for multitasking, then, may be simply to switch quickly back and\\nforth between the two tasks (or inputs or responses) rather than try to deal fully with\\nboth simultaneously. But how do you pick your moments? Listening to the car radio for\\na moment, then watching the road, then listening again is not a very practical (or rec-\\nommended) procedure, no matter how short each alternate period of attention is! We\\nstill do not know whether it is possible to perform two tasks at exactly the same time\\nor, if it is, what burden this arrangement places on the cognitive system.\\nA second problem that has muddied the dual-task waters is that it is not possi-\\nble to guarantee that when you do two things at the same time, you’re doing them in\\nexactly the same way as you would if you were performing each task singly. Several\\nresearchers have suggested that the participants learn to restructure the two tasks\\nand combine them into a single task (Schmidtke & Heuer, 1997; Spelke et al., 1976).\\nIf this is in fact what happens, and the dual tasks morph into a single task, it is dif-\\nficult to separate out and quantify performance on each of the tasks. Also, in this\\nmorphing, each task has in some way been altered to make the combination possi-\\nble, and so comparisons of the cost of dual tasks relative to the single task may not\\nbe legitimate.\\nIn any event, dual tasking may not be impossible, and one can develop immu-\\nnity to its adverse effects by becoming more proficient at one or both tasks. Let’s\\nlook again at the dual task of using a cell phone and driving. Using simulated con-\\nditions, researchers asked drivers to drive normally and, while doing so, to perform\\na secondary task such as changing the radio station or selecting and calling a num-\\nber on a cell phone (Wikman et al., 1998). To perform the secondary task, novice\\ndrivers frequently looked away from the road for more than 3 seconds at a time, a\\nlong (and dangerous) amount of time when you are on the highway. Under the same\\nconditions, experienced drivers glanced away from the road only for brief periods.\\nBecause they were proficient at driving and this skill had become more automatic for\\nthem, the experienced drivers knew how much time they could spend on the sec-\\nondary task without greatly affecting their driving. With enough practice and expe-\\nrience, a task can become more automatic and, as a result, less interference will be\\nobserved when it is performed in conjunction with another task.\\nIn the late 1970s two researchers used just this terminology and described pro-\\ncessing as being either automatic or controlled (Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977). Just as\\nour example of driving experience suggests, they found that people use automatic\\nprocessing on easy or very familiar tasks but are forced to use controlled processing\\nfor difficult or new tasks. However, controlled tasks can also become automatic with\\npractice over time.\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 115 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

When the Brain Fails\\nThe failures of selection described so far are part and parcel of the human experi-\\nence—we have all experienced them at one time or another. This normal pattern of\\nfailures, however, is massively exaggerated in those who suffer from hemispatial\\nneglect ,a  d e f i c i t  o f  a t t e n t i o n  i n  w h i c h  o n e  e n t i r e  h a l f  o f  a  v i s u a l  s c e n e  i s  s i m p l y  i g -\\nnored. The cause of hemispatial neglect is often a stroke that has interrupted the flow\\nof blood to the right parietal lobe, a region of the brain that is thought to be critical\\nin attention and selection (Figure 3–6a on color insert). When these patients are asked\\nto copy or even draw from memory a clock or a daisy (Figure 3–6b on color insert),\\nthey do not attend to (that is, they fail to select) information on the side of space op-\\nposite the lesion and so do not incorporate this information in their pictures. Similarly,\\nwhen they are asked to put a mark through all the lines that they see on a page set be-\\nfore them, their results often show gross disregard of information on the left side: they\\ncancel lines far to the right, as if the left part of the image were simply not there (Figure\\n3–6c on color insert). The reason for failure to select the information on the left (op-\\nposite the lesion) is not that they are blind on that side and fail to see the information.\\nRather, they do not seem to orient toward information on the left side of the scene be-\\nfore them and attend to it. If it is pointed out to them that there is information missing\\non the left side of their drawing, they may then go back and fill in the missing infor-\\nmation; but, left to their own devices, they apparently do not select information from\\nthe left side. The neglect is not restricted to visual information (further demonstrating\\nthat it is not a visual problem per se)—such patients may also ignore sounds or touch\\ndelivered to the left side, or even fail to detect smells delivered to the left nostril.\\nHemispatial neglect can make daily life unpleasant and sometimes dangerous.\\nPatients may eat food from only the right side of the dish, ignoring the food on the\\nleft, and then complain about being hungry. (If the plate is turned around so the re-\\nmaining food is on the right side, the problem is rectified.) They may shave or apply\\nmakeup to only the right half of the face. They may attend to only the right portion\\nof text, reading a newspaper headline\\nSPECTACULAR SUNSHINE REPLACES FLOODS IN SOUTHWEST\\nas\\nFLOODS IN SOUTHWEST\\nand may even neglect the left of some words that appear on the right side too, read-\\ning the title as\\nFLOODS IN SOUTH WEST\\nThey may neglect a left sleeve or slipper, and leave hanging the left earpiece of their\\neyeglasses (Bartolomeo & Chokron, 2001).\\nPeople with hemispatial neglect suffer deficits in their mental imagery as well as\\nin perception. Even when there is no sensory input, and the image is solely created\\nby their own memory, the side opposite the site of damage to the brain is a blank.\\nBisiach and Luzzatti (1978) demonstrated this by asking a group of hospitalized pa-\\ntients with hemispatial neglect, all of them residents of Milan, to describe in detail\\n116 CHAPTER 3 Attention\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 116 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Because the piazza was not in sight,\\nthis instruction required the patients to generate a mental image of it in order to de-\\nscribe it. Even though the information was being read off entirely from an internal\\nrepresentation and not from sensory input, the patients reported few details on the\\nside of space opposite the damage. This was not the result of memory failure or for-\\ngetting: the experimenters then asked the patients to imagine walking around the pi-\\nazza and viewing it from the side of the piazza opposite their point of view in their\\nfirst mental image. Once again, patients neglected the details on the side of space op-\\nposite their lesion, but now described the buildings and shops they had ignored in\\ntheir first description. The finding that hemispatial neglect patients neglect the left of\\ntheir mental images suggests that attention can operate not only to select information\\nfrom real perceptual input but can also select from a scene that is internally generated.\\nThere are some situations in which left-sided information can capture the attention\\nof the patient with neglect. Very strong and salient information that appears on the neg-\\nlected side of the input may successfully capture the patient’s attention in a bottom-up\\nfashion; a bright light or a sudden sound on the left side may do the trick. Top-down\\nguidance may also be helpful: specifically instructing the patient to attend to the left\\nmay reduce the extent of the neglect, but such guidance must be frequently reiterated.\\nAlthough the most obvious deficit in these patients is a failure to attend to left-\\nsided information in space, there is also evidence that there may be a failure to select\\ninformation in time. For example, Cate and Behrmann (2002) presented letters (such\\nas an “A” or an “S”) briefly (100-millisecond exposures) on the left and right sides of\\na computer screen and asked a patient with left-sided neglect to report which letters\\nappeared. When a letter was presented alone on the left side, the patient identified 88\\npercent of the letters correctly; this percentage was comparable to the 83 percent\\nreported correctly when the letters appeared alone on the intact right side. The inter-\\nesting finding occurred when both letters were presented together. (In some patients, it\\nis under these dual presentation conditions that the deficit for the left emerges most\\nstrongly.) If the letter on the left appeared first and remained on the screen for about\\n300 milliseconds before the appearance of the right letter, it was reported correctly\\nalmost as often as when it appeared alone. When the right letter appeared ahead of the\\nleft letter by 300 milliseconds however, the left letter was correctly reported only about\\n25 percent of the time. If, however, the right letter was presented first but enough time,\\nsay, 900 milliseconds, elapsed before the left letter appeared, the attraction associated\\nwith the right letter apparently decayed and the patient was free to attend to the left\\nletter. In this case, detection went back up to about 80 percent. These results are rem-\\niniscent of those in the attentional blink experiment.\\nThis study makes two important points: (1) When the left letter is on its own\\nand has no competitor to its right, it can survive the neglect; (2) when a competitor\\nis present on the right, the probability of the left letter’s being detected following a\\nshort temporal interval is reduced because the patient is still attending to the more\\nrightward letter. If enough time passes, however, the patient can attend to the left let-\\nter once again (Husain et al., 1997). Because the time also affects the outcome, it\\nsuggests that spatial (left–right) and temporal attentional mechanisms interact in de-\\ntermining how much information is neglected.\\n1.

Yes, but not many. The explanation usually of-\\nfered lies in the greater, and asymmetric, specialization of brain areas in humans. In\\nhumans, the areas involved in processing language are generally in the left hemi-\\nsphere, and attentional and spatial processes may therefore have been shifted into the\\nright hemisphere. In humans, then, damage to the right hemisphere gives rise to neg-\\nlect more often and with greater severity than does damage to the left hemisphere.\\n1.2. Successes of Selection\\nFortunately, the normal attention system is not as dumb as it may appear. Despite\\nthe many failures of selection we are prone to—which may come about because too\\nmuch information is present at any one location, or because too much information\\nstreams rapidly in time, or because our attention is divided—there are many condi-\\ntions under which we can successfully and efficiently select the necessary informa-\\ntion from the input presented to us.\\n1.2.1. Endogenous and Exogenous Effects in Space\\nWhen you were looking for your friend at the party, two kinds of information af-\\nfected your search. One came from within you: your knowledge of the color of her\\ndress. The other came from outside you: the sound of breaking glass. (In this case,\\nknowing the color of dress helped; the glass crash distracted.) These two types of\\nsources of information have been found to be highly effective determiners of what\\ninformation is attended.\\nWhen you came into the room, you searched very broadly and rapidly for all\\ngreen things in the array of colors that surrounded you and then, within this subset of\\ngreen things, specifically for your friend’s dress. This sort of attentional process, which\\nhas a voluntary aspect, is top down; it originates from within (from your own knowl-\\nedge, in this case) and hence is called endogenous attention .B u t  t h i s  f o r m  o f  g o a l -\\ndriven or top-down attention, can be overridden: salient and powerful stimuli can\\ncapture attention and direct you away from the task at hand. Attention thus captured\\nis described as exogenous attention ,b e c a u s e  i t  i s  d r i v e n  i n  a  b o t t o m - u p  f a s h i o n  b y\\nstimuli generated outside oneself. (Like the sound of the breaking glass, strong color\\ncan provide an exogenous cue, and can be very useful: little children on field trips and\\nprisoners in work-release programs wear brightly colored shirts for the same reason.)\\nThe most systematic studies that examine endogenous and exogenous forms\\nof attention are based on the idea of covert attention, which was developed by\\nHermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894), the German physiologist and physicist.\\nVon Helmholtz demonstrated that although the eyes may be directed at a specific spot,\\nvisual attention can be directed elsewhere “covertly,” that is, without overt motion\\nof the eyes. (Helmholtz achieved his experimental conditions by flashing a spark of\\nlight, which, as a highly salient stimulus, prevented physical motion of his eyes\\ntoward the region of space he was attending.)\\nIn modern studies, investigators seek to understand how endogenous and ex-\\nogenous cues influence information processing (Posner et al., 1980, 1982).

An endogenous cue such as an arrow\\nleads the participants to focus attention to that location even while their eyes are\\nkept on the fixation point. The arrow is a symbol; only after its meaning is under-\\nstood does a participant know how to shift attention—and hence attention is con-\\ntrolled by endogenous processes. On a large proportion of trials (usually around 80\\npercent), designated as “valid trials,” a target such as a small box is subsequently\\npresented at the cued location and participants press a response key as soon as they\\ndetect the presence of the target. In “invalid trials” an arrow cue appears pointing in\\nthe direction opposite the position of the target. Finally, in other, “neutral,” trials,\\nthe target appears at the same location but the arrow is not informative—it points\\nboth leftward and rightward.\\nThis study produced two main results. First, participants detected the target\\nfaster (and more accurately) in the valid condition compared to a neutral condition,\\nsuggesting that attending to a location can facilitate processing in that location, even\\nin the absence of eye movements. Second, participants detected the target in the in-\\nvalidly cued location significantly more slowly than in the neutral condition (and,\\nobviously, more slowly than in the valid condition). What was happening? The\\nparticipants were deceived or misled by the cue in the “wrong” position, which\\nguided their attention in a top-down, endogenous fashion; the subsequent shifting of\\nattention to the other side of the display cost them time. In normal participants, this\\npattern of costs and benefits is roughly the same whether the target appears on the\\nleft or the right of fixation (Figure 3–7b). Data from patients with hemispheric\\nneglect show a very different pattern (see Figure 3–7b).\\nAttention is also facilitated by a valid cue and inhibited by an invalid cue when\\nthe cue is exogenous. An example: this time two boxes are on the screen and one\\nbrightens momentarily, presenting a salient bottom-up cue. The target (e.g., a small\\nwhite box as in Figure 3–7a) then appears in either the cued or the noncued box; in\\nthe neutral condition, both boxes brighten. Attention is automatically drawn to the\\nside of the display with the salient bright box. As with endogenous cuing, the par-\\nticipants detect the target faster when it appears in the location indicated by the cue\\n(the valid condition) and detect it more slowly in the invalid condition.\\nAlthough the pattern of findings is very similar in the endogenous and exoge-\\nnous cases, there is one difference. In the exogenous version, attention can be rapidly\\nand automatically drawn toward the powerfully salient brightening cue and no ex-\\ntra processing time is needed. But exploiting the arrow cue in the endogenous ver-\\nsion requires that participants process the cue perceptually, understand its content,\\nand then use this information in a top-down fashion. If the arrow appears and the\\ntarget follows immediately thereafter, participants show neither the benefit nor the\\ncost of the presence of the cue. Given enough time (perhaps 150 milliseconds) to\\nprocess and implement the information provided by the cue, the facilitation and\\ninhibition emerge clearly.\\nThese studies amply demonstrate that facilitation and inhibition of detection are\\ninfluenced by the direction of attention alone, without overt eye movement. More\\nrecent results suggest that although it is possible under experimental conditions\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 119 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

The Nature and Roles of Attention 121\\n(such as those described here) to dissociate covert attention and eye movements, un-\\nder more natural circumstances, the two are tightly linked and may even rely on the\\nsame underlying network in the brain (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002). In fact, some re-\\nsearchers have suggested that the coupling of attention and eye movements is partic-\\nularly advantageous: attention can scout the visual scene first and then the eyes can\\nbe moved to regions containing particularly useful or salient information (Hoffman\\n& Subramaniam, 1995).\\n1.2.2. Components of Attention\\nWhat happens when patients with hemispatial neglect perform this attentional cueing\\ntask? Patients with lesions to the right parietal lobe, many of whom also suffered\\nhemispatial neglect, detected the valid targets normally on the nonneglected right side\\nand almost normally on the neglected left side (Posner et al., 1984, 1987). That is, they\\ncould still take advantage of the cue even though their performance was a little poorer\\nwhen the target appeared on the neglected side, and this was true whether the cue was\\nendogenous or exogenous. In the invalid trials, when the cue occurred on or pointed\\nto the neglected left side but the target appeared on the nonneglected right side, these\\npatients detected the target more slowly than in the valid trials. The extent of the slow-\\ning, however, was in the normal range; neurologically healthy participants, as we have\\nseen, also showed a cost in the reaction time in invalid trials. The important result is\\nthat in those invalid trials in which the cue occurred on (or pointed to) the non-\\nneglected right side and the target appeared on the neglected left side, the patients with\\nbrain damage needed roughly an additional 500 milliseconds to detect the target.\\nThe findings from patients with brain damage led Posner and colleagues to con-\\nstruct a model for attention that involves three separate mental operations: disen-\\ngaging of attention from the current location; moving attention to a new location;\\nand engaging attention in a new location to facilitate processing in that location\\n(Posner, 1990; Posner & Cohen, 1984). In the case of the right-hemisphere patients,\\nthe model suggests that when the cue directed attention to the nonneglected right\\nside and the target appeared on the neglected left side, the patients had trouble dis-\\nengaging attention from the good right side, and this deficit produced the dramati-\\ncally slower target-detection times. No “disengage” problem was apparent for targets\\non the nonneglected side when the preceding cue indicated the neglected side. In this\\nmodel then, there are several subcomponents of attention, and results indicate that\\nthe parietal lobe (especially on the right) plays a key role in one of them.\\nInterestingly, Posner and colleagues found other patient groups who appeared to\\nbe impaired in either the “move” or “engage” operations posited by their attention\\nmodel. Patients with damage to the midbrain and suffering from a disorder called\\nprogressive supranuclear palsy seemed to have no difficulty with “disengage” or\\n“engage” operations (Posner et al., 1985). Rather, they were slow in responding to\\ncued targets in the direction in which they had difficulty orienting, suggesting a\\nproblem in moving attention to the cued location. On the other hand, patients with\\nlesions to the pulvinar, a part of the thalamus (a subcortical structure), were slow to\\ndetect both validly and invalidly cued targets that appeared on the side of space op-\\nposite their lesion, but performed well when the targets appeared on the intact side\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 121 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

These results led the researchers to suggest that the thalamic\\npatients cannot engage attention on the affected side. The different patterns of per-\\nformance revealed by these three patient groups support the idea that attention can\\nbe decomposed into three separate functions (disengage–move–engage) and that\\neach can be selectively affected depending on which brain structures are damaged\\n(for an overview, see Robertson & Rafal, 2000).\\n1.2.3. Cross-Modal Links\\nAlthough many studies have focused on attentional effects in vision, there is also\\nevidence that facilitatory and inhibitory effects can be found within and across dif-\\nferent sensory modalities. Once you spotted your friend at the party visually, you\\nsuddenly heard her calling your name, but it was likely she’d been calling you for\\nsome time. Why did seeing her make her voice more audible?\\nA series of experiments has demonstrated cross-modal priming under both ex-\\nogenous and endogenous conditions (Driver & Spence, 1998; Kennett et al., 2002).\\n(As noted in Chapter 2, priming occurs when a stimulus or task facilitates process-\\ning of a subsequent stimulus or task.) In one experimental design, participants held\\ntactile stimulators that could vibrate at either the thumb or index finger in each\\nhand. Four light-emitting diodes were placed in corresponding locations in space.\\nWhen participants were asked to report the location of the tactile stimulus, the pres-\\nence of a noninformative visual flash on the same side of space speeded responses.\\nThe reverse condition was also true: a random tactile stimulus primed responses to\\nvisual targets on the same side. When participants crossed their hands, the priming\\nwas found to be aligned with external space (that is, the left hand crossed to the right\\nside of the body primed detection of a visual stimulus on the right). These effects\\nhave also been found between audition and touch, and between audition and vision.\\nSimilar cueing effects have been found when participants expect a stimulus in a\\nlocation in one modality and an unexpected stimulus appears on the same side of\\nspace in a different modality. For example, when expecting a visual stimulus on the\\nright, participants are quicker to detect a random tactile event on that side of space\\nthan one on the left. This finding suggests that directing attention to one side of\\nspace in one modality automatically results in attention to that location for other\\nmodalities as well.\\n1.2.4. Object-Based Attention\\nIn life, we are surrounded by objects, animate and inanimate, of all sorts, and attention is\\ndirected toward them as well as to locations in space and positions in temporal sequence.\\nRecent studies of object-based attention show that when attention is directed toward an\\nobject, all the parts of that object are simultaneously selected for processing (e.g., Jaomasz\\net al., 2005). An immediate example: you think of your friend in green as a single object\\n(and no doubt, because she’s a friend, as greater than the sum of her parts). As you focus\\non her, you would be more likely to notice the watch on her wrist, because it is a part of\\nher, than to notice the watch worn by the person standing next to her, even if that person\\nis standing just as close to you as she is—that watch is a part of a different object.\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/13/06  8:45 AM  Page 122 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

The Nature and Roles of Attention 123\\nMany studies of object-based attention demonstrate that an object and its asso-\\nciated parts and features are selected together. In one of the best-known studies\\n(Duncan, 1984), participants saw in the center of a computer screen a rectangular\\nbox with a gap in one side and a line through the box (Figure 3–8). When they were\\ninstructed to respond with two judgments about a single object—whether the box\\nwas big or small in relation to the frame of the screen and whether the gap was on\\nthe left or right side—accuracy of report was high. In fact, participants were almost\\nas good at reporting on the two features as when they were required to make only a\\nsingle judgment, on box size or gap side. Similar results were obtained when partic-\\nipants were asked to make the two judgments about the line itself—was it slanted or\\nupright, was it dashed or dotted? In a further condition, the two judgments the par-\\nticipants were asked to make concerned the box and the line, for example, the size\\nof the box and the texture of the line. This time, although again no more than two\\njudgments were required, accuracy fell significantly.\\nThe important aspect of this study is that both objects—box and line—were super-\\nimposed one on the other in the center of the screen, thus occupying the same spatial lo-\\ncation. The results with one object (box or line) and two objects (box and line) cannot\\nbe explained by preferential attention to a particular location in space. Instead, the re-\\nsult is compatible with the idea of object-based attention. Apparently, our perceptual\\nsystem can handle two judgments quite well when attention is focused on a single ob-\\nject. When attention must be divided across two different objects, however, making two\\njudgments becomes very difficult and performance suffers badly (this is similar to the\\ncost that occurs under dual-task conditions). These findings support the idea that at-\\ntention can be directed to a single object and all features of the object attended.\\nNeuroimaging has confirmed these behavioral results: when we attend to one\\naspect of an object, we perforce select the entire object and all its features\\n(O’Craven et al., 1999). Participants were shown pictures of a semitransparent face\\nsuperimposed on a semitransparent house and instructed to fixate on the dot in the\\ncenter of the superimposed images (Figure 3–9).

If attention were directed toward a spatial location, then we might have\\nexpected to see activation in all three brain regions, corresponding to the three stim-\\nulus types, given that all three occurred in the same region of space. If, however, se-\\nlectively attending to one attribute of an object also enhances processing of other\\nattributes of the same object, then we would expect greater activation in the brain\\narea representing co-occurring attributes of the selected object. And, indeed, that\\nwas the case. When motion was selectively attended, not only was MT activated, as\\nexpected, but the area representing the attended object (face or house) was also ac-\\ntivated. Thus, for example, the fusiform gyrus face area was activated when the face\\nwas moving compared to when it was static, even though the face itself was not\\npreferentially attended. The same was true for the parahippocampal place area\\nwhen the house moved. This suggests that in object attention, more than one fea-\\nture is simultaneously selected (say, house-and-moving or face-and-moving) and the\\ncorresponding neural areas reflect this coactivation.\\nEvidence from brain damage also supports the notion of object-based attention.\\nAlthough hemispatial neglect is predominantly thought of as a deficit in processing\\nin which attention to the left side of space after a right-hemisphere lesion is demon-\\nstrably poor, it has been shown that the left side of individual objects is also\\nneglected. In one study with neglect patients (Behrmann & Tipper, 1994; Tipper &\\nBehrmann, 1996), participants were shown a static schematic image of a barbell,\\nwith each end a different color (Figure 3–10). Participants were instructed to press a\\nkey when they detected a small white flashing light in either the left or right end of\\nthe barbell. As expected of patients with left-sided neglect, detection on the left was\\npoorer than on the right. But was this because the target appeared on the left of\\nspace (space-based neglect) or because the target appeared on the left of the object\\n(object-based neglect)?\\nIn a second condition, while participants watched, the barbell rotated so that the\\noriginal left end (as identified by its color) appeared on the right of space and the\\nright end of the barbell appeared on the left of space. Surprisingly, when the target—\\nthe flashing light—appeared on participants’ “good” side, the right of space (but in\\nthe end of the barbell that had previously appeared on the left), participants took\\nlonger to detect its presence. The poorer detection in the rotating case occurred pre-\\nsumably because the target fell on what had been the left end of the barbell. Simi-\\nlarly, when the target appeared on the left of space, performance was better than in\\nthe static condition, because it now fell on the right end of the object. A further, and\\nimportant, finding was that when the two circles that depicted the ends of the bar-\\nbell were not joined by a connecting bar, participants’ detection of targets on the\\nright of space was always good and detection of targets on the left of space was al-\\nways poor. In other words, no object-based neglect occurred, presumably because\\nthe two circles were not perceived as two ends of a single object; therefore, only\\nspace- and not object-based attention operated.\\nAn even more extreme case of object-based selection—or rather its deficit—can be\\nseen in patients with Bálint’s syndrome (for more information about this syndrome,\\nsee Rafal, 2001). This neurological disorder follows after bilateral (that is, on both\\nsides of the brain) damage to the parietal-occipital region; it is sometimes referred to\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 125 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

These patients are able to perceive only one\\nobject at a time; it is as if one object captures attention and precludes processing of\\nany others.\\nHowever, the failure to select more than one object can be reduced if the objects\\nare grouped perceptually. In one such study (Figure 3–11), Humphreys and Riddoch\\n(1993) had two patients with simultanagnosia view a display containing colored cir-\\ncles (each itself an object). On some trials, the circles were all the same color and on\\nother trials half the circles were one color, half another.

If, however, the two differently colored circles formed a single object by\\nvirtue of a connecting line, some of the difficulty of attending to each circle sepa-\\nrately was offset, and the patients did better in the mixed condition than in the other\\ntwo conditions. The cost of dividing attention between differently colored circles\\nwas reduced when these circles were joined to make a single object, and this im-\\nprovement was more dramatic than in either the random or single condition.\\nFIGURE 3–11 Simultanagnosia\\nPatients with simultanagnosia can attend to only a single object at a time; these patients can be\\nhelped when information in the visual scene is bound together to make a single object.

What are\\nsome examples of failures in space and in time?\\n2. What are the distinctions between exogenous and endogenous forms of atten-\\ntion?\\n2. EXPLAINING ATTENTION: INFORMATION-PROCESSING \\nTHEORIES\\n“Paying attention” encompasses dynamic processes that involve the enhancement or\\nselection of particular information and the inhibition of other information. Atten-\\ntion may be thought of as a mechanism that controls processing so that we are not\\noverwhelmed by too much information. Endogenous factors such as one’s knowl-\\nedge and goals and exogenous factors such as the salience of external information\\ncan influence the selection. But how does attention work? A number of different\\ninformation-processing theories have attempted to capture the dynamics of atten-\\ntional effects. Although none of these theories can explain all the attentional phe-\\nnomena we have described so far, the theories offer important insights into the\\nprinciples that underlie attentional effects.\\n2.1. Early versus Late Attentional Selection\\nAlmost all the experiments described here show that we can attend only to some of\\nthe sensory information that surrounds us and not to all of it. In the language of in-\\nformation processing, this selective aspect of attention is often a consequence of in-\\nadequate channel capacity or a fundamental limitation in the flow of information.\\nOne question is, when does selection occur, early or late in processing? Where is the\\nbottleneck? How much and what kind of information is processed before it, how\\nmuch and what kind after it? That essentially is the problem of “early versus late\\nattentional selection.”\\nThe British psychologist Donald Broadbent (1926–1993) favored the view that\\nselection is made at an early stage of processing. He proposed a model of the atten-\\ntional system as containing a limited-capacity channel through which only a certain\\namount of information could pass (Broadbent, 1958). The many sensory inputs ca-\\npable of entering later phases of processing, he believed, had to be screened to let\\nonly the most important information through. In his view, at an early stage of pro-\\ncessing, information comes into a very brief sensory store in which physical charac-\\nteristics of the input are analyzed: in the visual modality, these characteristics are\\nmotion, color, shape, spatial location; in the auditory modality, pitch, loudness, and,\\nagain, spatial location. Broadbent argued that the bottleneck is immediately after the\\nsensory store, and only a small amount of information, selected on the basis of phys-\\nical characteristics, passes through for further, semantic processing.\\n/checkbld\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 128 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Explaining Attention: Behaviorally Based Theories 129\\nBroadbent’s ideas were well received at the time; they successfully accounted for\\na range of empirical evidence. Some of this evidence had been presented by E. Colin\\nCherry (1953), another British psychologist, who recruited volunteers to participate\\nin an auditory experiment. Using a technique called dichotic listening (the literal\\nmeaning is listening with “two ears”), he played competing speech inputs through\\nheadphones to the two ears of his participants. For example, the right ear might\\nreceive “the steamboat chugged into the harbor” while the left ear simultaneously\\nreceived “the schoolyard was filled with children.” Cherry instructed participants to\\n“shadow,” that is, to follow and repeat as rapidly as possible one stream of speech\\ninput and to ignore the other. Cherry found that participants had no memory of\\nwhat was played in the unattended ear; in fact, they did not even notice if the unat-\\ntended message switched to another language or if the message was played back-\\nward. They did, however, notice whether the sex of the speaker was different or\\nwhether the speech became a pure tone.\\nCherry’s results (1953) are consistent with the early-selection bottleneck theory:\\nunattended inputs are filtered out and attended signals are admitted through on the\\nbasis of their physical characteristics. Changes in the physical aspects of a stimulus\\nwere attended, but if there were no such changes, the stimulus would either be at-\\ntended or filtered out. Consistent with the claim that unattended stimuli are filtered,\\nwhen the same word list was played to the unattended ear of participants 35 times\\n(Moray, 1959), the participants never noticed. The failure to detect the repeated\\nword lists indicates that the unattended signals were not processed deeply and the\\nparticipants did not have a representation of the words or their meaning.\\nBut one important piece of evidence suggests that a theory of early selection can-\\nnot be the whole story. Only a theory of late selection—which holds that, before the\\nbottleneck, all information is processed perceptually to determine both physical\\ncharacteristics and semantic content—could account for the finding that some infor-\\nmation could be detected in the unattended channel even when there was no change\\nin its physical features. This was especially true if the information was salient and\\nimportant to the participant. Hearing your friend call your name above the din of\\nthe party is a good example of how unattended but high-priority information can\\nstill be detected. Hearing your name at a loud party is such a good example of this\\nphenomenon that it’s known as the cocktail party effect . By early-selection views, the\\ncocktail party effect should not be possible; but there it is. Because it now seemed\\nthat unattended inputs were able to intrude and capture attention, Broadbent’s ideas\\nhad to be modified.\\nAdditional evidence to support late selection came from a number of studies us-\\ning dichotic listening. In one (Treisman, 1960), a different message was played into\\neach ear of participants. The logical content of each, however, was confused: the\\nleft ear heard “If you are creaming butter and piccolos, clarinets, and tubas seldom\\nplay solos ”; the right ear heard “Many orchestral instruments, such as sugar, it’s a\\ngood idea to use a low mixer speed. ” Participants were told to shadow the right ear,\\nbut some must have switched channels to follow meaning: they reported a reason-\\nable sentence about an orchestra, and believed they had shadowed the correct ear\\nall along.\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 129 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

About one-third of the participants reported hearing their\\nown name (and none reported hearing a different name). This finding is difficult to\\naccommodate within the early-selection view; it is also difficult to accommodate it\\nentirely within the late-selection view, because only one-third of the participants de-\\ntected their names on the unattended channel. One possible explanation is that this\\none-third occasionally switched attention to the unattended channel. This may in-\\ndeed be what happened: when Wood and Cowan instructed participants ahead of\\ntime to be ready for new instructions during the task, 80 percent of the participants\\nnow heard their name on the unattended channel. This finding undermines late\\nselection and suggests that participants may, for one reason or another, switch\\nattention to the other channel despite instructions.\\nHow can we reconcile these various results? One suggestion is that some kind of\\nanalysis must be done before the bottleneck, or filter, so that one’s own name or\\nother salient information can pass through (Moray, 1970). Arguing against this, an-\\nother suggestion holds that the early-selection view requires only a slight modifica-\\ntion (Treisman, 1969): that in each person’s “dictionary,” or lexical store, some\\nwords have lower thresholds of activation than others. Thus, information is still fil-\\ntered out early, but words that are well known by the listener are more easily de-\\ntected and require less analysis—and hence the information that does get through\\nthe filter is sufficient. Thus, one’s own name or a shouted “Fire!” would appear to\\npass through the bottleneck and capture the listener’s attention. Also, words that are\\nhighly probable given the semantic context (such as piccolo following shortly after\\ninstruments ) may also pass through to our awareness.\\n2.2. Spotlight Theory\\nLike a spotlight that highlights information within its beam, in this view, spatial at-\\ntention selectively brings information within a circumscribed region of space to\\nawareness, and information outside that region is more likely to be ignored. This\\nmetaphor works—up to a point.\\nConsistent with the idea that spatial locations can be enhanced when they fall in\\nand around the spotlight, participants who correctly named letters appearing at mul-\\ntiple locations in the visual field were more likely to succeed at an orientation dis-\\ncrimination task when the forms to be discriminated appeared near the letters. These\\ndata (Hoffman & Nelson, 1981) suggest that information is enhanced when it ap-\\npears near the current position of the spotlight.\\nBut the spotlight metaphor breaks down. For one thing, a number of experiments,\\ndiscussed earlier, have shown that attention can be directed to a single object, even if su-\\nperimposed on another object, demolishing the idea that a “spotlight” of attention\\nhighlights information in a particular spatial region. If that were true, all objects would\\nbe selected together, but we know that one object can be preferentially selected. Another\\ndifficulty is the assumption of the spotlight model that the beam of attention sweeps\\nthrough space. If that’s what happens, one would expect that if an obstacle intervened\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 130 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Explaining Attention: Behaviorally Based Theories 131\\nin the course of the sweep, attention would be captured or hampered by this obstacle.\\nBut it isn’t. In a study that investigated this expectation (Sperling & Weichselgartner,\\n1995), participants monitored a stream of digits appearing at a fixation point. At the\\nsame time, they were to attend to a rapidly changing stream of letters appearing to the\\nleft of the fixation point and to report any appearance of the letter “C.” Occasionally\\nanother character appeared between the fixation stream and the letters on the left—that\\nis, it interfered with any “spotlight beam.” But this “interference” made no difference:\\nwhether or not intervening information appeared, the time taken to detect a letter “C”\\nwas constant. These results suggest that attention is not influenced by the presence of\\nspatially intervening information, as would be expected from a spotlight model.\\nRather than thinking about attention as a spotlight where information outside the\\nselected region is simply ignored, more recent studies have begun to characterize atten-\\ntion as a dynamic process in which information selection is automatically accompanied\\nby active inhibition of other information. Thus, rather than as a spotlight, attention can\\nbe understood as a competitive system in which tuning into one thing results in the in-\\nhibition of competing information. Attending to green things will result in inhibition of\\nthings of other colors (helping you find your friend on our party example), attending to\\na single object such as a person will result in inhibition of other people or objects, at-\\ntending closely to music may inhibit to some degree unrelated visual information.\\nAttention, then, is a dynamic push–pull process that involves both increasing and de-\\ncreasing the likelihood that certain locations or objects will be processed in detail. These\\nideas are elaborated in greater detail in the final section of this chapter.\\n2.3. Feature Integration Theory and Guided Search\\nThis theory, which has a very different emphasis from ideas of bottlenecks, filters,\\nand spotlights, is mostly concerned with the role attention plays in selecting and\\nbinding complex information. This question has been particularly well investigated\\nin experiments using a visual search task. In this design, a display is presented on a\\ncomputer screen; participants are instructed to find a target piece of information\\nand press a response key when they do. For example, participants may be in-\\nstructed to search for the circle in a display such as that shown in Figure 3–12a.

Try it: the difference between these two types\\nof trials will be immediately apparent. It is absurdly easy to locate the target on the\\nleft, but the display on the right poses more difficulty. Displays like that on the left\\nare referred to as disjunctive (or feature ) search trials. In these trials the target dif-\\nfers from the other characters or symbols—the distractors—by a single feature,\\nsuch as shape (circle among squares). A distractor is a nonrelevant stimulus that is\\nsupposed to be ignored. Displays such as the one in Figure 3–12b are conjunctive\\nsearch trials, in which the target is defined by a conjunction of features—her e, (blue\\nversus white) and shape (circle versus square).\\nYour experience with Figure 3–12 no doubt suggested that disjunctive search is\\ngenerally easier; you’re right. Even increasing the number of elements in the display\\nin disjunctive search does not slow down target detection—the search can be done\\neffortlessly and rapidly. The target seems to pop out at you; this kind of search is\\ndescribed as preattentive; that is, it takes place before attention is engaged. Because\\nthe target pops out regardless of the number of elements in the display, it is likely\\nthat the search is conducted in parallel across the display; that is, all elements are\\nevaluated at the same time. In conjunctive search, however, each element must be\\nattended and evaluated individually to determine whether or not it is the target.\\nAdding more elements to conjunctive search slows you down substantially and, in\\nfact, an additional increment of time is required to detect the target for each addi-\\ntional item included in the display. Because you must examine each item serially to\\nsee whether it has the requisite conjunction of attributes, the time to find the target\\nincreases dramatically as the number of distractors increases.\\nThe cognitive difference between disjunctive and conjunctive search is well\\ncaptured by feature integration theory (FIT) (Treisman & Gelade, 1980). Accord-\\ning to FIT, the perceptual system is divided into separate maps, each of which reg-\\nisters the presence of a different visual feature: color, edges, shapes. Each map\\ncontains information about the location of the features it represents. Thus, the\\nshape map of the display in Figure 3–12a would contain information about some-\\nthing of a particular shape at the right of the screen. If you know that you are look-\\ning for a target defined by that shape, you need only refer to the shape map, which\\ncontains all the shapes present in the display. The shape you are looking for will\\npop out of this shape map and target detection proceeds apace, irrespective of the\\nnumber of distractors of another shape. Looking for a conjunctive target, however,\\nrequires the joint consultation of two maps, the shape map and the color map. FIT\\nsuggests that attention is required to compare the content of the two maps and\\nserves as a kind of glue to bind the unlinked features of, say, “COLORness” [blue]\\nand “circleness” to yield a [blue] circle.\\nFeature integration theory has illuminated other aspects of the way attention\\noperates in visual search. One important finding is that you can search faster for the\\npresence of a feature than for its absence; participants are able to find the “Q”\\n(essentially a circle with a tail) among the “O”s in Figure 3–13a much faster than the\\n“O” (essentially a circle without a tail) among the “Q”s in Figure 3–13b. In fact,\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 132 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

For example, participants sometimes make illusory\\nconjunctions ,t h a t  i s ,  i n c o r r e c t  c o m b i n a t i o n s  o f  f e a t u r e s .  F o r  i n s t a n c e ,  i f  p a r t i c i p a n t s\\nreport on the elements present in Figure 3–12b, if the display is presented very\\nbriefly, they may report the presence of a white square. This response, incorrectly\\ncombining features (COLORness and squareness) present in the display, suggests\\nthat these features are registered separately but that they are not properly bound to-\\ngether. When attention is overloaded or the features are not selected together, the iso-\\nlated features remain unbound and may be incorrectly attached to other features\\n(Treisman & Schmidt, 1982).\\nDo brain studies support the distinction between disjunctive and conjunctive\\nprocesses? Some neuroimaging studies have indicated that different types of features\\nreally are being registered by partially distinct neural mechanisms, as assumed by\\nfeature integration theory. But the evidence is not incontrovertible, and some find-\\nings from patients with hemispatial neglect present a challenge to FIT. Patients with\\nhemispatial neglect fail to take into account information on the side of space oppo-\\nsite the lesion, and the deficit has been assumed to be one of failing to attend to that\\nside. According to FIT, disjunctive search is preattentive and does not engage atten-\\ntion, whereas conjunctive search does involve attention. If this distinction is correct,\\nthen one might predict that neglect patients would be able to perform disjunctive\\nsearch well, even when the target appears on the neglected side. The findings suggest\\nthat this is not true. Behrmann and colleagues (2003) tested the visual search per-\\nformance of a large group of neglect patients on the “Q”s and “O”s search task, ma-\\nnipulating the number of elements in the display from 1 to 16 items. As expected,\\nthese patients took a very long time, compared with control participants, to detect\\nthe presence of the “O” among the “Q”s on the right side (remember, this is the\\nmore difficult search, for the absence of a feature).

The “Q” did not pop out for these patients: either they failed to\\nlocate the target or took a very long time to do so, suggesting that even disjunctive\\nsearch may require attention and the preattentive–attentive distinction between\\nthese forms of search may not hold.\\nAdditionally, even behavioral studies with neurologically unimpaired partici-\\npants have found that some conjunctions are easier to detect than a purely serial\\nsearch model predicts (Nakayama & Silverman, 1986). Consequently, a new the-\\nory, guided search, was proposed (Wolfe, 2003; Wolfe et al., 1989). As indicated\\nby the name, output from a first stage of information processing “guides” later se-\\nrial search mechanisms. Although the first stage is similar to that of FIT in that it\\nis constructed of different feature maps, it differs in that items that cannot possi-\\nbly be the target are eliminated in parallel in the feature maps. In the example of\\nFigure 3–12, processing within the color feature map would label all the white\\nitems as distractors and all the color items as potential targets. The same sort of\\nlabeling would occur for the square versus circle stimuli within a shape feature\\nmap. Thus, by the time information reaches the second attentive stage, the number\\nof candidate targets is already much reduced compared to the total number of\\nitems possessing one feature of the target. Guided searching accounts for a relatively\\nefficient search of conjunction targets by allowing information from the preattentive\\nfeature stage to reduce the number of items over which attentionally demanding\\nserial searches occur.\\nComprehension Check:\\n1.

These\\nin turn have furthered our knowledge of the mechanisms that give rise to atten-\\ntion. For example, it is now a well established behavioral finding that when at-\\ntention is directed to a location, perception of that information is enhanced. Until\\nfairly recently, however, we did not know whether this was because the target at\\nthe cued location was more efficiently processed in the visual areas of the brain or\\nbecause the motor system was biased to produce faster responses. Both these ex-\\nplanations are reasonable accounts of the findings of faster target detection. To\\nexplore further, researchers have conducted attention studies with animals and\\nhumans using various biological methods.\\n134 CHAPTER 3 Attention\\n/checkbld\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/13/06  8:45 AM  Page 134 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Looking to the Brain 135\\n3.1. Electrophysiology and Human Attention\\nIn the late 1960s, technology was developed that allowed researchers to measure\\nwith considerable precision the variation in electrical activity generated by the\\nbrain. Although it was known that faint waves are emitted by the brain in response\\nto a stimulus, it had not previously been possible to average these tiny signals and\\nrelate them specifically to the processing of that stimulus. More sensitive electrodes\\nplaced on the scalp and more powerful computers to make the calculations could\\ndo the job. With technological advances, it became possible to distinguish between\\nan event-related potential (ERP)—the change in electrical activity in response to a\\nstimulus—and the sorts of brain activity that go on all the time. Investigators were\\nnow able to explore the neural mechanisms associated with various cognitive\\nprocesses, including the phenomenon of selective attention.\\nThe major result from some of these ERP studies was that directing attention to-\\nward a stimulus results in an increase in the amplitude of the waveform as early as\\n70 to 90 milliseconds after the onset of the stimulus. These changes are recorded in\\nthe first positive, or P1, wave over lateral occipital regions of the scalp (in the visual\\nsystem) and suggest that attention enhances the early processing of visual stimuli in\\nthe brain, which leads to better perceptual detection of the attended target stimulus.\\nFor example, a study that recorded ERPs during tasks involving covert attentional\\ncueing (such as that depicted in Figure 3–7) found a difference in the P1 waveform\\n(and also in the first negative wave, N1) between cued and uncued trials for targets\\nin both the left and right visual fields. Larger sensory ERPs were recorded in early\\nstages of visual processing when the targets were in cued locations (Mangun &\\nHillyard, 1991). Attending to a location apparently increased the amount of visual\\nprocessing, giving rise to a larger ERP signal. A similar increase in the sensory ERP\\noccurs when attention is exogenously drawn to a location if the target appears\\nwithin 300 milliseconds of the exogenous cue. Again, an early occipital wave is en-\\nhanced, consistent with enhanced visual processing of the target.\\nTaken together, these results suggest that exogenous, automatic attention and\\nendogenous, voluntary attention (in other words, bottom-up and top-down forms of\\nattention) have at least some underlying processes in common, an implication con-\\nsistent with the behavioral findings discussed earlier. Furthermore, the enlargement\\nof early waveforms at the occipital cortex is consistent with the idea that selection\\noccurs early in the processing stream and that incoming sensory signals may be en-\\nhanced early as a result of attention. But, as we will see, some attentional processing\\nmay also occur later.\\nInterestingly, just as cross-modal links confer benefits in behavioral tasks, inter-\\nactions between different primary sensory areas revealed by ERP studies have simi-\\nlar effects. For example, paying attention to either an auditory or a tactile stimulus\\nappearing on one side of space resulted in enhanced ERPs within the first 200 mil-\\nliseconds at electrodes in primary visual areas. Thus, attending to one side of space\\nin the tactile or the auditory domain automatically resulted in enhanced attention to\\nvisual information on that side. This result indicates that when a salient event takes\\nplace at a given location in one modality, spatial attention is directed to that location\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 135 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

This seems to\\nbe a very efficient way of wiring up the attentional system, and the result at a\\ncrowded party is that when you spot your friend visually, you are better able to hear\\nand localize the sound of your own name.\\n3.2. Functional Neuroimaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\\nData from ERP studies have been very useful in demonstrating that some atten-\\ntional modulation occurs during the first phases of cortical processing, and in\\nshowing similarities across endogenous and exogenous cueing and across visual,\\nauditory, and tactile domains. These data have been able to do this because of the\\ntemporal precision of the ERP technique, allowing measurement of changes in\\nbrain waves over time even down to a matter of milliseconds. But ERP methods\\nare not that good at indicating exactly which region of the brain is responsible for\\ngenerating the brain waves. Because the electrodes are placed on the head and the\\npotentials are recorded at the surface of the scalp, we can never be perfectly sure\\nof the location of the brain region producing the potentials. Functional neu-\\nroimaging serves as a good complementary approach: its temporal precision is\\nnot as good as that achieved by ERP methods, but its spatial precision is far bet-\\nter. The two main functional neuroimaging methods, positron emission tomogra-\\nphy (PET) and fMRI, measure blood flow or metabolism in very particular\\nregions of the brain. Their use in attention studies can demonstrate the regional\\nconsequences of attending to a stimulus. (For a fuller discussion of methodologi-\\ncal issues, see Chapter 1, Section 4.)\\nIn one of the early PET studies, participants were required to shift attention be-\\ntween locations—in this case, boxes aligned horizontally across the visual field—and\\nto press a button when a target appeared in one or the other of the boxes (Corbetta,\\net al., 1993). The experimenters found that the superior (i.e., upper) parietal lobe in\\nthe right hemisphere was consistently activated during attentional shifts compared\\nto periods when fixation was maintained in the middle of the screen (Corbetta et al.,\\n1993; Vandenberghe et al., 2001). The involvement of the superior parietal lobe was\\nalso evident in another visual search study, especially when the target contained a\\nconjunction of features. Although other regions of the brain, including the basal gan-\\nglia, thalamus, insular cortex, frontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate, also show\\nenhanced activation during attentional switching in visual search tasks, the parietal\\nlobe seems to play the primary role.\\nAnother experimental design used PET to monitor brain activation as partici-\\npants inspected an image for a change in either its color, motion, or shape (Corbetta\\net al., 1990). In addition to the parietal cortex, brain areas associated with process-\\ning motion were activated when participants attended to motion. Similarly, when\\nparticipants attended to color, brain areas associated with color were activated. The\\nimportance of this correspondence is the demonstration that while the parietal\\ncortex plays an important role, it is intimately linked with other brain areas that\\nreflect the attentional modulation of the relevant features of a display.\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 136 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Looking to the Brain 137\\nThe studies of attention have become increasingly sophisticated, and there have\\nbeen attempts to differentiate the neural processes associated with different forms of\\nattention. For example, Corbetta and Shulman (2002) showed that different neural\\nsystems are used when attention is directed to a location before the appearance of a\\nstimulus (an endogenous condition) and when an unexpected salient stimulus appears\\n(an exogenous condition) and redirects a participant’s attention. They found that in\\ncases of endogenous attentional orientation, a network of frontal and dorsal parietal\\nareas (including the intraparietal sulcus, IPS; superior parietal lobule, SPL; and the\\nfrontal eye fields, FEF) was involved. Searching for your friend in a crowded room in-\\nvolved voluntary reorientation of attention that would activate this frontoparietal net-\\nwork of brain areas. On the other hand, effects involving exogenous mechanisms of\\nattention, such as those arising from the harsh sound of shattering glass, were found\\nto activate a more ventral system that included the temporal parietal junction (TPJ)\\nand ventral frontal cortex. The authors hypothesized that this latter system is involved\\nin the detection of unexpected salient or novel information. The two systems were de-\\nscribed as functionally independent but interactive (Figure  3–14).

Conversely, information about the importance of the\\nstimulus from the voluntary system may modulate the sensitivity of the ventral system,\\nproviding a top-down way for your intentions or goals to influence how strongly your\\nattentional system will be distracted by exogenous information.\\nThe notion that attention operates over time as well as over space—for which there\\nis behavioral evidence from studies on attentional blink and repetition blindness—is\\nsupported by evidence from neuroimaging. You’ve been looking for your friend for\\nsome time without success. Have you missed her? Has she left? Some people are begin-\\nning to leave the party. As more and more people start looking for their coats, you be-\\ncome ever more vigilant in looking for a patch of green. Such expectations for the\\nappearance of a stimulus in time have also been reflected in activation of the fron-\\ntoparietal brain areas, suggesting that the voluntary attentional neural network oper-\\nates temporally as well as spatially (Coull et al., 2000; Wojciulik & Kanwisher, 1999).\\nIt is probably not surprising that after damage to this region, patients not only are im-\\npaired in attending to information on the side of space opposite the lesion (as in hemis-\\npatial neglect), they are also impaired in attending to information that is presented in a\\nrapid temporal stream.\\nEvidence from a completely different technique, transcranial magnetic imaging\\n(TMS), has also confirmed the critical role of parietal cortex in attention. This\\ntechnique, which was also discussed in Chapter 1, allows a magnetic field to be\\npassed through the neurons in a particular region of the brain, putting those\\nneurons into a state in which they are inhibited from being activated by incoming\\nstimuli. This technique, which is used with nonneurological participants, in effect\\ninduces a temporary “lesion” in healthy brains lasting a few seconds or minutes\\n(with no demonstrable consequences after the study is completed). TMS studies\\nwith normal participants can therefore be thought of as analogous to studies of\\npatients with damage to specific regions of the brain (such as patients with\\nhemispatial neglect). TMS applied to the right parietal cortex of normal partici-\\npants led them to require more time for conjunctive search but not for searches for\\nsimple features (Ashbridge et al., 1997). (Recall from earlier in the chapter that\\nconjunctive search, but not simple-feature search, requires attention.) Interestingly,\\nthis increased time to search after TMS can be eliminated by training participants\\non the conjunctive search task (Walsh et al., 1998), perhaps thus making it more\\nautomatic and less demanding of attention. Another TMS study, which disrupted\\nthe IPS in one or the other brain hemisphere, resulted in impaired detection of stim-\\nuli on the side of space opposite the site of TMS; but this was true only when two\\nstimuli were presented, one on the left and one on the right (Hilgetag et al., 2001).\\nTogether these studies appear to support the idea that the superior and posterior\\nparietal lobes are involved in attentional shifts, and that damage to these areas\\nresults in a bias for attention to be directed to the side of space that is registered by\\nthe “intact” hemisphere, as is true in hemispatial neglect.\\nThe ERP studies provide much support for early selection and enhancement of\\nvisual cortex processing during periods of attention; the PET and fMRI studies\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 138 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

These in-\\nclude parietal cortex and frontal cortex; imaging studies have also shown activation\\nin occipital cortex, confirming the ERP studies (Gandhi, et al., 1999). The most im-\\nportant message from these studies is that attention does not simply engage one area\\nof the brain. Rather, attention is implemented in a wide, distributed circuit to which\\ndifferent brain regions contribute. “Attention” involves selection that can occur\\nearly, late, or at both times, and be driven by our will or by the strength of stimuli in\\nthe environment and on the basis of space or objects or time. And so the most fruit-\\nful way of thinking about attention is as a dynamic system that flexibly allows for\\nselection in many different ways. These studies of neural systems in the human brain\\ncomplement the behavioral studies described in previous sections.\\nComprehension Check:\\n1. Describe two different methods that have been used to study the brain basis of\\nattention.\\n2. Do the ERP studies support an early or a late view of attentional selection? In\\nprinciple, could ERP results provide support for both views? If so, how? If not,\\nwhy not?\\n4. COMPETITION: A SINGLE EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK \\nFOR ATTENTION?\\nConceptualizations of selective attention have undergone many transformations\\nover the history of attention studies. Early theories drew analogies between atten-\\ntion and a filtering mechanism or bottleneck that operated in accordance with a set\\nof early perceptual or later semantic criteria. Later theories recast attention as the\\nselective distribution of a limited amount of cognitive resources. Now attention\\nwas seen not as a discrete gateway or bottleneck but as a modulatory influence\\nthat could increase or decrease the efficiency with which demanding processing is\\nperformed. Considered in this way, attention is a far more flexible mechanism—\\ncapable of facilitating or inhibiting processing of the input—than a simple spotlight\\nor filter. Data from many differently designed studies have suggested ways in which\\nattention may be implemented in the brain; many different brain areas, from the\\nposterior occipital lobe, to the anterior frontal lobe, appear to be involved in\\nattentional processing.\\nIs there a general theory of attention that embraces the findings from neural\\nstudies and observed behavior? The answer is yes. This is the theory of biased com-\\npetition, or integrated competition, developed by Desimone and Duncan (1995) and\\nDuncan and colleagues (1997).\\nFrom the perspective of this theory, attention is seen as a form of competition\\namong different inputs that can take place between different representations at all\\nstages of processing.

A very strong bottom-up signal\\n(such as a shattering glass at a party) would be rapidly and efficiently processed,\\neven above the ambient noise of the party. Competition (and selection, which is the\\nresult of the competition) between noise-of-breaking-glass and general-noise-of-\\nparty would occur in auditory cortex. The same sort of competition would occur\\nwith inputs in other sensory modalities.\\nThe competition between inputs can be biased by the influence of other cogni-\\ntive systems. Focusing on visual processing, Desimone and Duncan (1995) argue that\\nattention is “an emergent property of many neural mechanisms working to resolve\\ncompetition for visual processing and control of behavior” (p. 194). Instead of char-\\nacterizing attention as a spotlight that highlights particular regions of space for pro-\\ncessing, or as a bottleneck or filter, these investigators characterize attention as an\\nintegral part of the perceptual or cognitive process itself. Competition occurs be-\\ncause it is impossible to process everything at once; attention acts as a bias that helps\\nresolve competition be tween inputs. So, for example, if the input contains a gray cir-\\ncle, competition would occur between different color representations (or the neurons\\nthat constitute the representations), and gray would win; the neurons of that repre-\\nsentation would fire, and gray would be considered the winning input. The source of\\nthe bias can come either from the features in the external stimulus (exogenous) or\\nfrom the relevance of a stimulus to one’s goals of the moment (endogenous).\\nThe competition that takes place between possible inputs occurs in multiple\\ndifferent brain regions. For example, competition in earlier areas of the visual sys-\\ntem will tend to be influenced by exogenous factors such as color or motion. This\\ncompetition will, in turn, affect more anterior brain regions to which these lower-\\nlevel areas send information for further processing. There, however, endogenous\\nfactors, such as relevance or goals, will tend to bias the competition in regions of\\nthe brain involved in formulating plans for how to pursue specific goals. This\\nlater competition can also send information back to the regions of lower-level pro-\\ncessing and modulate the influence of exogenous factors at that level. The theory\\nholds that many different brain regions are involved in such competition, and be-\\ncause they are connected, the competition is integrated across them. The ultimate\\nwinner of the competition—the item that is ultimately attended—is determined by\\na consensus among all the different regions working together. Given this perspec-\\ntive, findings that so many different brain areas contribute to attentional selection\\nare not surprising.\\nOne of the original motivations for the idea of competition came from a single-\\ncell recording study in which monkeys were trained to perform a visual search task\\n(Moran & Desimone, 1985). The important result was that when two targets were\\nin the same receptive field, they competed for the cell’s responses. However, when\\none of the objects was the target and the other was a distractor, the neuron re-\\nsponded primarily to the target stimulus and blocked processing of the distractor\\nstimulus. If you imagine these competitive processes occurring all along the process-\\ning stream, one way to understand attention is to think of it as a gating mechanism\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 140 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

The outcome of the competition is a winner that is selected for further, pref-\\nerential processing.\\nSeveral ERP and fMRI studies have shown how the ERP waveform or the acti-\\nvation of various brain regions is enhanced or magnified under conditions of com-\\npetition. These increases occur when participants perform more difficult\\ndiscriminations (Lavie, 1995), when distractors compete with targets, and when the\\ndemands of a task are increased. When task demands are increased as in dual-task\\nconditions, less activation is observed in areas associated with a simultaneous sec-\\nondary task, reflecting the decrease in processing of nonselected information.\\nCompetitive effects are also seen when stimuli appear simultaneously rather\\nthan sequentially, probably reflecting mutual suppression by simultaneously com-\\npeting stimuli. When four visual stimuli were present, there was less activation in\\nvisual cortical area V4 than when only one was present (Kastner et al., 1998). How-\\never, when participants were asked to attend to just one of the four stimuli that were\\npresented simultaneously, activation went up to a level similar to that observed with\\na single stimulus presented alone (see accompanying, A Closer Look box). In the\\nframework of integration competition theory, attending to a single object effectively\\nreduced the amount of competition from other stimuli and biased processing toward\\nthat stimulus.\\nOther demonstrations of attentional modulation, obtained with both fMRI and\\nERP techniques, have been found in V1 and other early visual cortical areas\\n(Brefczynski & DeYoe, 1999; Gandhi et al., 1999; Luck & Hillyard, 2000; Noesselt\\net al., 2002; Somers et al., 1999). some researchers have even found very early at-\\ntentional effects in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, a key informa-\\ntional relay station between the retina and visual cortex in the back of the brain\\n(O’Connor et al., 2002). These results indicate that, as the theory holds, information\\ncan be sent back to areas that accomplish earlier processing and thereby bias subse-\\nquent processing. Moreover, there is some suggestion that feedback connections to\\nearly visual cortex are involved in determining our conscious experience of visual in-\\nformation (Pascual-Leone & Walsh, 2001).\\nCompetition is also evident when a participant is required to divide attention\\nacross two perceptual features. Compared with a simple condition in which no stim-\\nulus appears on the screen and the participant stares at a fixation point, attending to\\nthe color or the shape of a stimulus that appears on the screen leads to greater acti-\\nvation of many visual areas. Moreover, if the participant has to switch between at-\\ntending to the color and attending to the shape, additional areas of the brain become\\nengaged and—no surprise—regions of parietal cortex are also active (Le et al., 1998;\\nLiu et al., 2003).\\nMany of the findings that demonstrate failures of selection in space or in time\\ncan be explained by the idea of competition between stimuli.

The work, by Sabine Kastner, Peter De Weerd, Robert Desimone, and Leslie\\nUngerleider, was reported in 1998 in “Mechanisms of Directed Attention in the Human Extrastriate Cortex\\nas Revealed by Functional MRI,” Science, 282, 108–111.\\nIntroduction\\nThe investigators used fMRI to test ideas about competition and attentional selection. The idea being ex-\\nplored is that the visual system is limited in its capacity to process multiple stimuli at any given time. The\\nhypothesis: in order for objects to be selected, competition must occur between available objects to yield\\na “winner.” The suppression of the eventual winner by the “losing” stimuli would give rise to a reduction in\\nthe signal measured by fMRI. In addition, the investigators argue that this suppression can be overcome\\neven when multiple objects are present: if attention is directed to one of the objects specifically, the re-\\nsponse would be enhanced and lead to stronger fMRI signals.\\nMethod\\nEight participants viewed images appearing on a screen while lying in the fMRI scanner. Two conditions were\\nused in the first experiment. In the sequential condition, four complex images were shown in random loca-\\ntions on the screen but only one object was ever present at a single time. In contrast, in the simultaneous con-\\ndition, the same four complex images were present, but in this condition all four were present at the same\\ntime. Because competition (and suppression) can take place when all four are simultaneously present, the ex-\\npectation was that the fMRI signal from visual cortex in the simultaneous condition would be lower than the\\nsum of the four fMRI signals in the sequential condition. The second experiment was the same as the first but\\nnow, in some sets of trials, participants were instructed to attend to a particular location in which one stimu-\\nlus was presented and to count the occurrences of a particular target stimulus at that location.\\nResults\\nMarkedly weaker signals were observed in many visual areas of the brain in the simultaneous than in the\\nsequential condition, supporting the idea that the stimuli presented together competed with one another\\nand, in so doing, led to the suppression of some of them. When stimuli are presented one at a time, each\\ncan activate the brain fully and so the sequential condition leads to stronger fMRI signals. It is interesting\\nand important that in the second experiment, when the participants attended to the location of one of the\\nstimuli, there was an increase in the strength of the fMRI signal, and this signal was even larger than in the\\nsequential condition in some visual areas of the brain.\\nDiscussion\\nThe hypothesis was that competition among multiple stimuli would lead to suppression and that this would\\nbe reflected by a reduction in the fMRI signal. This was indeed the case, and this finding provides support\\nfor the idea that attention is a dynamic process in which stimuli compete for selection. Competition, then,\\nmay be the means by which unwanted stimuli are filtered out (they are suppressed and have little or no ac-\\ntivation). The second experiment shows that one can enhance some stimuli by attending to them even if\\nthere are many stimuli present; this finding shows that along with suppression, enhancement occurs when\\none selects a subset of items for further processing.\\nA CLOSER LOOK\\nCompetition and Selection\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 142 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Competition: A Single Explanatory Framework for Attention? 143\\nof the valid cue and the location of the target are one and the same, and hence co-\\noperation rather than competition prevails. Also, the effects of divided attention\\ncan be interpreted as the result of competition between different inputs or differ-\\nent tasks, as opposed to the noncompetitive case, in which the focus is exclusively\\non a single input or a single task. The improvement, in the form of automaticity,\\nthat comes with greater practice with dual tasks may be thought of as a reduction\\nin the competition between the two tasks. Moreover, the performance of patients\\nwith hemispatial neglect can also be understood within this framework of compe-\\ntition. If the damage to the right side of the brain allows the intact hemisphere to\\nproduce a bias away from the left side and toward the right side, that bias in-\\ncreases the competitive strength of right-sided stimuli and reduces that of left-sided\\nstimuli.\\nFailures of selection in time lend themselves to a similar explanation. The\\nfailure to report T2 in the attentional blink task (see Figure 3–4) might arise from\\ncompetition between T1 and T2. Reporting T2 when it is not preceded by T1 is\\nnot problematic—there is no competition. However, the requirement to report T2\\nwhen it is preceded by T1 and is very similar to T1 in appearance (say, the letters\\nare “A” and “H”) establishes a highly competitive environment and reduces the\\nchances of detection of T2. Competition may also explain the failures of selection\\nin time observed with patients with hemispatial neglect. When visual stimuli are\\npresented on both sides, reporting of the stimulus on the neglected side improves\\ndepending on the timing of presentation of the two stimuli and their grouping.\\nOne might think of these two factors, time and grouping, as biases that can\\ninfluence the outcome of the competition between stimuli on the right and on\\nthe left.\\nIt seems, then, that almost all the behavioral experiments we have discussed\\ncan be interpreted in terms of a competition between “stronger” and “weaker”\\nstimuli, with strength defined by a combination of bottom-up and top-down\\ninfluences. Although not all the details of biased competition have been worked\\nout yet, this framework allows us to explain a wide range of findings; its direc-\\ntion is promising. The advantage of this theory is that it underscores the idea that\\nattention is a bias in processing, and that processing occurs through cooperative\\nand competitive interactions among brain areas. Because the different brain\\nareas are connected, they will all contribute to the selection of the target. By com-\\nbining the behavioral results with the inferred involvement of particular brain\\nareas, it is possible to begin to develop an understanding of how attentional\\neffects are manifested in the neural system and how those changes affect cognition\\nand behavior.\\nComprehension Check:\\n1.

What is attention, and how does it operate during cognition?\\nAttention is the process whereby we can select from among the many competing\\nstimuli present in our environment, facilitating processing of some while inhibit-\\ning processing of others. This selection can be driven endogenously by our goals\\n(e.g., to find a particular friend, to follow an instruction, to use an arrow to direct\\nattention), or exogenously by a salient or novel stimulus that captures attention\\naway from the task at hand (e.g., bright light, loud noise). Because there is too\\nmuch information at any given moment for us to cope with, attention is the mech-\\nanism by which the most important information is selected for further processing.\\nThe type of information that we miss and the conditions under which we miss it\\nare, therefore, the flip side of the cognitive processes involved in attentional selec-\\ntion. Being unaware of the posters on the wall at a party is a failure of selection\\nthat is a property of selectively searching for features of a friend. Although we are\\ncapable of processing only a limited quantity of information in both space and\\ntime, fortunately selection does not occur randomly. Both our goals and the\\nsalience of information around us determine where and to what we attend. This\\nbalance between endogenous and exogenous factors not only allows us to accom-\\nplish our goals effectively, such as finding an individual in a crowd, but also to be\\nsensitive to important external information, such as a fire alarm or crashing glass.\\nThink Critically\\n■ Describe the differences between endogenous and exogenous attentional pro-\\ncessing in space and in time.\\n■ What would it be like if you were equally aware of all the visual and auditory\\ndetails of your environment at once?

Attention as a biasing signal acts within as well as between perceptual\\nand cognitive systems.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10. (Image source: Google Blog, 2020)\\nCheck more MIPS algorithms and performance comparison in ann-benchmarks.com.\\nComponent Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

       " 'summary': 'Hunter × Hunter (pronounced \"hunter hunter\") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha\\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 38 tankōbon volumes as of September 2024. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\\nHunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter.\\nThe manga has been licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim\\'s Toonami programming block from April 2016 to June 2019.\\nHunter × Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.',\n",

The story begins with a young boy named Gon Freecss, who one day discovers that the father who he thought was dead, is in fact alive and well. He learns that his father, Ging, is a legendary \"Hunter\", an individual who has proven themselves an elite member of humanity. Despite the fact that Ging left his son with his relatives in order to pursue his own dreams, Gon becomes determined to follow in his father\\'s footsteps, pass the rigorous \"Hunter Examination\", and eventually find his father to become a Hunter in his own right.\\nThis second anime television series adaptation of Hunter × Hunter was announced on July 24, 2011. It is a complete reboot starting from the beginning of the original manga, with no connection to the first anime television series from 1999. Produced by Nippon TV, VAP, Shueisha and Madhouse, the series is directed by Hiroshi Kōjina, with Atsushi Maekawa and Tsutomu Kamishiro handling series composition, Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the characters and Yoshihisa Hirano composing the music. Instead of having the old cast reprise their roles for the new adaptation, the series features an entirely new cast to voice the characters. The new series premiered airing weekly on Nippon TV and the nationwide Nippon News Network from October 2, 2011.  The series started to be collected in both DVD and Blu-ray format on January 25, 2012. Viz Media has licensed the anime for a DVD/Blu-ray release in North America with an English dub. On television, the series began airing on Adult Swim\\'s Toonami programming block on April 17, 2016, and ended on June 23, 2019.\\nThe anime series\\' opening theme is alternated between the song \"Departure!\" and an alternate version titled \"Departure! -Second Version-\" both sung by Galneryus\\' vocalist Masatoshi Ono. Five pieces of music were used as the ending theme; \"Just Awake\" by the Japanese band Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas in episodes 1 to 26, \"Hunting for Your Dream\" by Galneryus in episodes 27 to 58, \"Reason\" sung by Japanese duo Yuzu in episodes 59 to 75, \"Nagareboshi Kirari\" also sung by Yuzu from episode 76 to 98, which was originally from the anime film adaptation, Hunter × Hunter: Phantom Rouge, and \"Hyōri Ittai\" by Yuzu featuring Hyadain from episode 99 to 146, which was also used in the film Hunter × Hunter: The Last Mission. The background music and soundtrack for the series was composed by Yoshihisa Hirano.\\n\\n',\n",

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been ﬁrmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 29, 2, 5].

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

The conﬁguration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α= 0.6 [31]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of ﬂoating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision ﬂoating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\n9'),\n",
